# Introduction

This is a simple application where we are learning to do web development.

## Contributors

* Del -- CTO, Instructor, Deployment, Chief Bottle Washer, Photographer
* Sascha -- Java expert and instructor
* Nhu -- Front end
* Huy, Vu -- Back end, Deployment (students)
* Nghi -- student

## Goals

For the time being we are just learning about how to do a simple web application with a separate front end and back end. We have chosen some technologies as follows:

* Front End -- ReactJS
* Back End -- Java, Spring Boot
* Deployment -- Docker, Docker Compose
* Database -- MySQL (for now)
* Authentication -- 0auth

The functional requirement is to create a simple photo website where a photographer can create a photo album, upload some photos, and give people access to those photos to view and download.
